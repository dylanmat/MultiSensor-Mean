Generate a Hubitat App using Groovy which will allow you to select mulitple devices and create a child device which represents the average of the select devices.

This take the attributes like Illuminance, Temperature, Humidity, and UltraViolet Index and the child device will just take those attributes and average them for it's own equivalent attributes.

The App should...

For each child device
- Allow a custom name to be defined
- Allow selecting multiple devices as input
- Allow determining the update cycle for the average, this should support constant realtime changes as well as custom cycle by minutes 1-60

APP_VERSION=0.0.1 to start, and should increment for each pull request. major updates should increment the first digit and big changes should increment the second. bug fixes/minor changes should only increment the last digit
APP_NAME="MultiSenor Mean" for non-main branches this should be appended with "Test"
APP_BRANCH="main" this should be updated for each pull request with the name of the new branch, restoring to main once the merge to main occurs
APP_UPDATED=Should be the date of the last modification in PDT/PST

README.md should be updated to contain basic usage instructions and append each version change like a change log.
